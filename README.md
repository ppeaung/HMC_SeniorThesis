## An Adaptive Hegselmann-Krause Model of Opinion Dynamics 

#### About 

The Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model is a synchrnous model of opinon dynamics on a network. In this work, we expand upon the model by letting connections between nodes evolve over time via a homophily parameter. We study the model through numerical simulations on multiple graphs. This work is associated with a senior capstone project, which the pdf can be found in this repository. 

The repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the adaptive HK model as well as a sigmoidal opinion dynamic model which was developed after the completion of the senior capstone project. Generation of graphs with various parameters are also included.
